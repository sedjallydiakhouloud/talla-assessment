Filament Image Gallery Application
This is a Filament-based web application that integrates with the Art Institute of Chicago API to fetch, manage, and favorite images. The application consists of three main pages: Image Gallery (API integration), My Images (user-uploaded images), and Favorites (favorited images from both sources). It supports search, pagination, favoriting, downloading, and basic animations.
Assessment Overview
This project fulfills the following requirements:
1. Image Gallery Page (API Integration)

API Source: Fetches images from the Art Institute of Chicago API.
Image URL: Utilizes the IIIF Image API to generate image URLs.
Features:

Displays images in a grid layout with:

The image itself.
Title of the artwork.
"Favorite" icon (‚ù§Ô∏è/ü§ç) to toggle favorite status.
"Download" icon (‚¨áÔ∏è) to download the image.
"View" icon (üëÅÔ∏è) to zoom in a modal with title.


Implements local filtering for search by title (after fetching data).
Supports pagination with "Prev" and "Next" buttons.
Allows image downloads via a dedicated controller.
Enables favoriting of API images, stored in the favorites table.
Uses Alpine.js for simple zoom animation on click.


Best Practices: Follows API guidelines for field selection, pagination, and image URL construction.

2. My Images Page

Purpose: Displays all images uploaded by the authenticated user.
Features:

Each image displays:

Image.
Title.
Description.
"Favorite" icon.
"Download" icon.

Allows users to add new images with:

Maximum file size: 6MB (validated as max:2048).
Required fields: Title and optional Description.
Uploaded files stored in public/uploads.

Supports downloading and deleting user-added images.
Includes search by title and pagination with configurable items per page (5, 9, 15, 30).
Favoriting toggles with validation and logging for debugging.

3. Favorites Page

Purpose: Displays all images favorited by the user, including both API-fetched and user-added images.
Features:
Each image displays:
Image (with fallback placeholder if not available).
Title (fetched dynamically for API images).

Allows users to unfavorite images with a remove button ("X") and animation.
Supports search and pagination (12 items per page by default).
Handles both API and user images uniformly, with detailed logging for debugging.
Includes a Filament resource for admin management.

Prerequisites

PHP: 8.1 or higher.

API Access: Internet connection for the Art Institute of Chicago API.
Storage: Configured public disk for uploaded images.

Clone the Repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/filament-image-gallery.git
cd filament-image-gallery

Install Dependencies:
bashcomposer install

Configure Environment:

Copy the .env.example file to .env:
bashcp .env.example .env

Update .env with your database credentials:
textDB_CONNECTION=sqlite  # Or mysql/postgresql
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/your/database.sqlite  # For SQLite

Generate an application key:
bashphp artisan key:generate



Set Up the Database:

Run migrations to create tables (users, user_images, favorites):
bashphp artisan migrate



Link Storage (for uploaded images):
bashphp artisan storage:link

Compile Assets:
bashnpm run dev

Start the Development Server:
bashphp artisan serve


Usage

Access the Application:

Navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or your server URL).
Register/login as a user (Filament handles auth).


Image Gallery Page:

URL: /admin/gallery (Filament page).
Search artworks by title (local filter).
Paginate with "Prev/Next".
Favorite, view (modal zoom), or download images.


My Images Page:

URL: /admin/my-images (Filament page).
Upload images with title/description (max 2MB).
Search by title, paginate (configurable per page).
Favorite, download, or delete images.

Favorites Page:

URL: /favorites (custom route).
View favorited images with search/pagination.
Unfavorite with the "X" button.

Project Structure

app/Filament/Pages/Gallery.php: Handles API fetching, search, pagination, and favoriting for the gallery.
app/Filament/Pages/MyImages.php: Manages user image uploads, display, search, pagination, and favoriting.
app/Http/Controllers/ImageDownloadController.php: Downloads API images.
app/Http/Controllers/MyImagesController.php: HTTP handlers for my images (upload, delete, download, favorite).
app/Http/Controllers/FavoriteController.php: Handles favorites listing, unfavoriting, with API/user image support.
app/Models/Favorite.php: Model for favorites, with relations and API fetching.
app/Models/UserImage.php: Model for user-uploaded images.
resources/views/gallery.blade.php: View for gallery grid and modal.
resources/views/favorites.blade.php: View for favorites grid with placeholders and debug info.
routes/web.php: Defines routes for downloads, my-images, and favorites.
database/migrations/: Assumed migrations for user_images and favorites tables.

Additional Notes

API Usage: Respects Art Institute API best practices (field limiting, pagination). No authentication required.
Security: Validates uploads (max 6MB), restricts actions to authenticated users. Foreign keys are managed with logs for SQLite issues.
Debugging: Extensive logging in controllers (check storage/logs/laravel.log) for image URLs, favorites, and errors. Debug info in views for IDs/URLs.
Limitations: Search in My Images/Favorites is local (no API). Favorites may show placeholders if images fail to load. No initial seed data.
Customization: Adjust image sizes in CSS (e.g., height: 256px in gallery-item img). Update validation in controllers as needed.
